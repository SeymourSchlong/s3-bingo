This version is modified from the original at [Go1den/s3-bingo](https://github.com/Go1den/s3-bingo), kept up-to-date.

## Unique Features for this fork
### Main-weapon bingo
  * The bingo sheet will only contain main weapons, no alt kits. You can choose which kit to play.
### Version restriction
  * The bingo sheet will only contain weapons from the given version or below.
### "Splattershot" weapon category is merged into "Frontline" and "Backline" shooter categories
  * It was a little unnecessary, plus there was not enough to play Balanced cards.
### Smaller, compressed assets
  * Images are smaller in size, and now use an outline to separate it from the background better.
